# Caesar Cipher Python

## Description

This project implements the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm in Python. The Caesar cipher is one of the oldest and simplest methods of encrypting information. It works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.

### Features

- Encrypt and decrypt messages with a specified shift amount.
- Handles non-alphabet characters by leaving them unchanged.
- User-friendly command-line interface for input.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine (Python 3.x is recommended).
3. Run the `caesar_cipher.py` script using your terminal or command prompt.
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
